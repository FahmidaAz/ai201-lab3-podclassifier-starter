    Build a few-shot classification prompt using the student's labeled training examples.

    Your prompt needs to:
      1. Describe the task and the four valid labels
      2. Show the labeled training examples so the LLM can learn the pattern
      3. Present the new description and ask for a classification

    The LLM should return a single label from VALID_LABELS (exactly as written)
    plus a brief explanation of its reasoning. Think carefully about the output
    format you request — you'll need to parse it in classify_episode().

    Before writing code, complete specs/classifier-spec.md.
